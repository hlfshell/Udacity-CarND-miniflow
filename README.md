In Lesson 5 of the [Self Driving Car Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) offered by Udacity, you create, piece by piece, a library called MiniFlow. The library is a core component recreation of some aspects of Tensorflow in order to learn key concepts via 1st principles.

While this is done in the browser, I followed along and create the library in my chosen IDE in order to create a good study material and play around with the library further.
